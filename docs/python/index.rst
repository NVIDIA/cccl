CCCL Python Libraries
======================

Welcome to the CCCL Python libraries! This collection provides Pythonic interfaces to
CUDA Core Compute Libraries (CCCL).

The CCCL Python libraries consist of two main components:

:doc:`cuda.compute <compute>`
  Parallel computing primitives for operations on entire arrays or data ranges.

:doc:`cuda.coop <coop>`
  Block and warp-level cooperative algorithms for building custom CUDA kernels with Numba.
