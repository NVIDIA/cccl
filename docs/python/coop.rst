``cuda.coop`` brings CCCL's optimized cooperative algorithms to Python GPU
kernels. Use it when threads need to work together, such as summing a tile
of values or arranging data for the next stage of a computation. These
operations run inside a kernel, where you can combine them with your own
code and reuse algorithms maintained and tuned for NVIDIA GPUs.

The common Python API works with Numba-CUDA-MLIR and CUTLASS CuTe DSL, using
CUB underneath. You keep your compiler's kernel syntax and launch
conventions, and use ``cuda.coop`` for the cooperative parts of the work.

Get started
-----------

Choose the guide for the kernel language you use:

* The :doc:`Numba-CUDA-MLIR Programming Guide <coop/programming_guide>`
  starts with a complete kernel and host code to launch it.
* The :doc:`CUTLASS Programming Guide <coop_cutlass>` shows how to use the
  same operations in CuTe kernels and work with CuTe register tensors.

For Numba-CUDA-MLIR, install the extra matching your CUDA major version:

.. code-block:: console

   python -m pip install "cuda-coop[numba-cuda-mlir-cu13]"
   # Use numba-cuda-mlir-cu12 with CUDA 12.

   <span id="coop-numba-context-lifetime"></span><span id="cuda-devices-and-context-lifetime"></span>

Check the Numba guide's :ref:`requirements and kernel reuse limits
<coop-numba-requirements>` before running your first kernel.

For CUTLASS, install the base package alongside a compatible CuTe runtime:

.. code-block:: console

   python -m pip install cuda-coop

Check the :ref:`CUTLASS runtime requirements <coop-cutlass-requirements>`
before installing: this integration currently requires a compatible
Linux/CUDA 13 environment, and an official public runtime artifact has yet
to be qualified.

Inside a kernel
---------------

A cooperative operation acts on a *group* of threads, usually a warp or a
block. Each thread owns part of the group's data, held in a ``ThreadData``
object. Together, those parts form a tile.

For example, these calls load a full tile, compute its prefix sums, and
write the result back to memory:

.. code-block:: python

   # Inside a kernel, with `coop` imported from `cuda`:
   block = coop.this_block()
   items = coop.ThreadData(items_per_thread)

   coop.load(block, source, items, offset=offset)
   prefixes = coop.exclusive_sum(block, items)
   coop.store(block, destination, prefixes, offset=offset)

The kernel supplies the tile's ``offset`` and a compile-time
``items_per_thread`` count. With 128 threads and four items per thread, the
block processes 512 values. Each block computes its own prefix sum; a
device-wide scan also needs to combine results across blocks.

All threads in the group must reach these calls. For a final, partial tile,
use the operations' valid-item controls while keeping the whole group
involved. Both programming guides show the complete code, including tail
handling and the compiler's launch syntax.

Common API and compiler extensions
----------------------------------

Use ``from cuda import coop`` for the common API. Numba-CUDA-MLIR and
CUTLASS implement its operations with the same argument conventions and
behavior. The surrounding kernel code, including array arguments and
launches, follows your compiler's conventions.

The qualified namespaces, ``cuda.coop.numba_mlir`` and
``cuda.coop.cutlass``, include the common operations and add features for
their compiler. For example, the Numba API accepts device callbacks, and
the CUTLASS API can convert existing CuTe register tensors to ``ThreadData``.
The :ref:`Numba <coop-programming-api-choice>` and
:ref:`CUTLASS <coop-cutlass-api-choice>` guides explain when to use these
extensions.

Import your kernel compiler before ``cuda.coop`` to activate its integration
automatically. In a notebook or library where import order can vary, use
explicit :ref:`backend registration <coop-backend-registration>`.

The :doc:`interactive visualizations <coop/visualizations/index>` let you
step through operations and see which values each thread owns. Use the
:doc:`API reference <coop_api>` to find an operation's parameters and
return values, or the :doc:`FAQs <coop/faqs>` for practical questions.

To work on the integration itself, follow a kernel through the
