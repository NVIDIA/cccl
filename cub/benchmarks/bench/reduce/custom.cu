// This benchmark uses a custom reduction operation, max_t, which is not known to CUB, so no operator specific
// optimizations (e.g. using redux or DPX instructions) are performed. This benchmark covers the unoptimized code path.

// Because CUB cannot detect this operator, we cannot add any tunings based on the results of this benchmark. Its main
// use is to detect regressions.
