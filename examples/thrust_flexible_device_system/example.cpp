This is a simple example demonstrating the use of CCCL functionality from Thrust, CUB, and libcu++.

The example computes the sum of an array of integers using a simple parallel reduction. Each thread block
computes the sum of a subset of the array using cuB::BlockRecuce. The sum of each block is then reduced
to a single value using an atomic add via cuda::atomic_ref from libcu++. The result is stored in a device_vector
from Thrust. The sum is then printed to the console.
