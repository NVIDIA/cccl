# `<cuda/std/complex>`

## Omissions

When using libcu++ with NVCC, `complex` does not support `long double` or
  `complex` literals (`_i`, `_if`, and `_il`).
NVCC warns on any usage of `long double` in device code, because `long double`
  will be demoted to `double` in device code.
This warning can be suppressed silenced with `#pragma`s, but only globally, not
  just when using `complex`.
User-defined floating-point literals must be specified in terms of
  `long double`, so they lead to warns that are unable to be suppressed.

## Customizations

### Handling of infinities

Our implementation by default recovers infinite values during multiplication and division. This adds a significant runtime overhead, so we allow disabling that canonicalization if it is not desired.

Definition of `LIBCUDACXX_ENABLE_SIMPLIFIED_COMPLEX_OPERATIONS` disables canonicalization for both multiplication *and* division.

Definition of `LIBCUDACXX_ENABLE_SIMPLIFIED_COMPLEX_MULTIPLICATION` or `LIBCUDACXX_ENABLE_SIMPLIFIED_COMPLEX_DIVISION` disables canonicalization for multiplication or division individually.

### Support for half and bfloat16 (since libcu++ 2.4.0)

Our implementation includes support for the `__half` type from `<cuda_fp16.h>`, when the CUDA toolkit version is at
least 12.2. This is detected automatically when compiling through NVCC. If you are compiling a host-only translation
unit directly with the host compiler, you must define the macro `LIBCUDACXX_ENABLE_HOST_NVFP16` prior to including any
libcu++ headers, and you must ensure that the `<cuda_fp16.h>` header that's found by the compiler comes from a CUDA
toolkit version 12.2 or higher.

Our implementation includes support for the `__nv_bfloat16` type from `<cuda_bf16.h>`, when the conditions for the
support of `__half` are fulfilled, and when `CUB_DISABLE_BF16_SUPPORT` is **not** defined.
