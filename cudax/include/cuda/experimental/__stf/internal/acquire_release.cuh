/**
 * @brief Acquires necessary resources and dependencies for a task to run.
 *
 * This function prepares a task for execution by setting up its execution context,
 * sorting its dependencies to avoid deadlocks, and ensuring all necessary data
 * dependencies are fulfilled. It handles both small and large tasks by checking
 * the task size and adjusting its behavior accordingly. Dependencies are processed
 * to mark data usage, allocate necessary resources, and update data instances for
 * task execution. This function also handles the task's transition from the setup
 * phase to the running phase.
 *
 * @param ctx The backend context in which the task is executed. This context contains
 *            the execution stack and other execution-related information.
 * @param tsk The task to be prepared for execution. The task must be in the setup phase
 *            before calling this function.
 * @return An event_list containing all the input events and any additional events
 *         generated during the acquisition of dependencies. This list represents the
 *         prerequisites for the task to start execution.
 *
 * @note The function `EXPECT`s the task to be in the setup phase and the execution place
 *       not to be `exec_place::device_auto`.
 * @note Dependencies are sorted by logical data addresses to prevent deadlocks.
 * @note For tasks with multiple dependencies on the same logical data, only one
 *       instance of the data is used, and its access mode is determined by combining
 *       the access modes of all dependencies on that data.

/**
 * @brief Releases resources associated with a task and transitions it to the finished phase.
 *
 * This function releases a task after it has completed its execution. It merges the
 * list of prerequisites (events) that are marked as done, updates the dependencies for
 * the task's logical data, resets the execution context to its original configuration,
 * and marks the task as finished.
 *
 * After calling this function, the task is considered "over" and is transitioned
 * from the `running` phase to the `finished` phase. All associated resources are unlocked
 * and post-submission hooks (if any) are executed.
 *
 * @param ctx The context of the backend, which manages the execution environment.
 * @param done_prereqs A list of events that must be marked as complete before the task can be released.
 *
 * @pre The task must be in the `running` phase.
 * @pre The task's list of prerequisites (dependencies) must be empty at the time of calling.
 *
 * The function performs the following actions:
 * - Merges the provided list of `done_prereqs` into the task's list of prerequisites.
 * - Updates logical data dependencies based on the access mode (read or write).
 * - Ensures proper synchronization by setting reader/writer prerequisites on the logical data.
 * - Updates internal structures to reflect that the task has become a new "leaf task."
 * - Resets the execution context (device, SM affinity, etc.) to its previous state.
 * - Unlocks mutexes for the logical data that were locked during task execution.
 * - Releases any references to logical data, preventing potential memory leaks.
 * - Executes any post-submission hooks attached to the task.
 *
 * The function also interacts with tracing and debugging tools, marking
 * the task's completion and declaring the task as a prerequisite for future tasks in the trace.
 *
 * @note After calling this function, the task is no longer in the `running` phase
 * and cannot be modified.
 *
 * @warning The task must have completed all its work before calling this function.
 * Failure to follow the task's lifecycle correctly may lead to undefined behavior.
