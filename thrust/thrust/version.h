 *  \brief Compile-time macros encoding Thrust release version
 *
 *         <thrust/version.h> is the only Thrust header that is guaranteed to
 *         change with every thrust release.
 *
 *         It is also the only header that does not cause THRUST_HOST_SYSTEM
 *         and THRUST_DEVICE_SYSTEM to be defined. This way, a user may include
 *         this header and inspect THRUST_VERSION before programatically defining
 *         either of these macros herself.
