  # Disabling the pull_request trigger to avoid double runs on NVIDIA/cccl.
  # This was added to support CI on forks, but would launch two runs on
  # NVIDIA/cccl: one for the push to the copy-pr-bot branch, and one for
  # the pull_request event.
  # Since the CI job gates branch protection checks and the pull_request
  # trigger causes that job to be skipped (which counts as "success" for GHA branch
  # protections...), PRs could be merged regardless of the real 'on-push' workflow status.
