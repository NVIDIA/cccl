Usage: $0 <name> <regex> [<regex> ...]

Create a compressed artifact, suitable for large, temporary files such as build products or test binaries
that need to be quickly uploaded and downloaded between CI jobs. The artifact will exist of a
zip file containing an <artifact_name>.tar.bz2 archive, packed with the parallel pbzip2 if available.

Regexes are passed to the `find` command's -regex option in the current directory.
'./' is prepended to all regexes for convenience.
The artifact will contain all matching files relative to the current directory.

If no regexes are provided, the artifact will be created from a file in the current directory.
The file must have the same name as the artifact.

Example Usage:

  Create an artifact of the given file in the current directory using the filename as the artifact name:

    $0 some_resource.log

  Copy all files that match the regexes to a staging directory, and upload a artifact that zips this directory.

    $0 job-\$JOB_ID-products \
       'build\.ninja$' \
       '.*rules\.ninja$' \
       'CMakeCache\.txt$' \
       '.*VerifyGlobs\.cmake$' \
       '.*CTestTestfile\.cmake$' \
       'bin/.*' \
       'lib/.*'
