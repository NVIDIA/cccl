# CCCL Python cuda.compute benchmarks

This directory contains the code for the Python cuda.compute benchmarks.
They are migrated from the original C++ benchmarks.

The original C++ benchmarks are available in this repository in: ../../../../cub/benchmarks/bench/
We follow the same directory structure and naming conventions converting to Python were appropriate.

The benchmarks use nvbench to run the benchmarks and report the results.
