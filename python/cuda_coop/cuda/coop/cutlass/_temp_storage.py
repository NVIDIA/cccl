"""Describe scratch reuse while CuTe traces a kernel.

The descriptor holds compile-time policy and identity, not a device pointer.
Finalization allocates storage after C++ layout probes establish its size.
The MLIR hooks expose no values and rebuild to the same object, so traced
loops keep the descriptor identity used to group storage requests.

    """Describe shared-memory requirements for operations in one kernel.

    Parameters, defaults, synchronization rules, and the executable reuse
    example follow :func:`cuda.coop.TempStorage`. Only supported block
    algorithms accept an explicit descriptor. Its contents are opaque to user
    code. See :ref:`temporary storage <coop-common-storage>` for allocation
    lifetime and :ref:`the CUTLASS example <coop-cutlass-storage>` for reuse.

    Attributes
    ----------
    size_in_bytes : int or None
        Explicit positive capacity, or ``None`` to infer it from all uses.
        An explicit capacity must cover the resolved allocation.
    alignment : int or None
        Optional minimum byte alignment, expressed as a power of two. The
        planner also satisfies the C++ primitive's alignment requirement.
    auto_sync : bool
        Whether each scratch-using call emits a trailing block barrier.
        Defaults to ``False``; ``None`` is normalized to ``False``. Without
        automatic barriers, the caller must synchronize before scratch reuse.
    sharing : {"shared", "exclusive"}
        Shared calls use one slice sized for the largest requirement.
        Exclusive calls get separate slices in trace order. Repeated
        execution of one call site reuses its slice, including in a loop.

    Equal settings do not combine separate descriptors. Reuse the same object
    to share an allocation across calls in a kernel. The descriptor carries
    no runtime MLIR values. Finalization supplies the storage operands.
